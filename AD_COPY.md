## 🎤 Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second Pitch (Conference/Networking)

> "Africa has the most innovative payment systems in the world—M-Pesa, Paystack, MTN MoMo. But integrating them is a nightmare. Each has a different API, different auth, different edge cases. 
>
> We built the Africa Payments MCP Server—one protocol that works with all of them. Just say 'Send KES 5,000 via M-Pesa' and it happens. 
>
> It's open source, built by Africans, and ready to power the next generation of African fintech."

### 60-Second Pitch (Investor Meeting)

> "Africa is the future of fintech. M-Pesa alone processes more transactions than Western Union globally. Yet integrating these payment systems takes developers weeks of wrestling with SOAP APIs, scattered documentation, and unique edge cases.
>
> We built the Africa Payments MCP Server—a unified protocol that connects AI agents to every major African payment provider. Instead of 500 lines of code and three weeks of work, developers can just say 'Send KES 5,000 to Mary via M-Pesa' and it happens.
>
> It's open source, MIT licensed, and already gaining traction with developers across the continent. Think of it as the USB-C of African payments—one connection, everything works.
>
> We're not just building a tool; we're building the infrastructure that will power AI-native fintech across Africa."

### 10-Second Pitch (Quick Intro)

> "We're the Stripe for African payment integration—one API, every provider, minutes instead of weeks."

### Cold Outreach to Developers

**Subject:** Tired of wrestling with M-Pesa's SOAP API?

```
Hey [Name],

I saw you're working on [project/company]—looks like you're building something interesting in African fintech.

Quick question: How long did your last payment integration take?

If you're like most developers we talk to, the answer is "way too long." M-Pesa's SOAP API, Paystack's quirks, MTN MoMo's sandbox issues...

We built something to fix that.

Africa Payments MCP is a unified server that lets you integrate all major African payment providers in minutes, not weeks. Just say "Send KES 5,000 via M-Pesa" and it happens.

It's open source, MIT licensed, and already saving developers hours of integration time.

### Newsletter Feature Request

**Subject:** Feature Pitch: The USB-C of African payments

```
Hi [Editor],

I hope this finds you well. I'm reaching out about a new open source project that might interest your readers.

What we're building:
Africa Payments MCP Server—a unified protocol that connects AI agents to M-Pesa, Paystack, MTN MoMo, and other African payment providers through natural language.

Why it matters:
African fintech developers currently spend weeks integrating payment APIs that use different protocols (SOAP, REST, etc.) and have scattered documentation. We're reducing that to minutes.

The angle:
As AI agents become more common, they need to transact. But no MCP server existed for African payments—until now. This is infrastructure for the next generation of African fintech.

Happy to provide more details, demos, or interviews if you're interested.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Reddit Ad Copy

**Title:** [Show HN] I built a unified API for African payments (M-Pesa, Paystack, MTN MoMo)

**Body:**
```
Hey r/programming,

After spending 3 weeks integrating M-Pesa's SOAP API for a side project, I decided to build something better.

Africa Payments MCP is a Model Context Protocol server that lets you (and your AI agents) interact with African payment providers through natural language.

Instead of:
- 500 lines of integration code
- Weeks of documentation diving
- Handling each provider's quirks

You get:
- "Send KES 5,000 to Mary via M-Pesa"
- Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor
- Open source, MIT licensed

It's still early days, but I'd love feedback from fellow developers!
